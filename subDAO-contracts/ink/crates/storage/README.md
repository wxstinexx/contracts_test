**IMPORTANT NOTE:** WORK IN PROGRESS! Do not expect this to be working.

ink! is an [eDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) to write WebAssembly based smart contracts using the Rust programming language targeting Substrate blockchains.

For more information please visit [the ink! tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/0/building-your-contract).

### Interaction with Substrate

Substrate's [Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularised Entities (FRAME)](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/next/conceptual/runtime/frame) contains the `contracts` pallet, which provides a generic smart contract interface for Wasm blobs. It takes care of e.g. state rent, storage, costs, etc..

ink! is a smart contract language which targets the interface exposed by
`contracts`. As such, ink! smart contracts are compiled to Wasm.

### Scripts

Use the scripts provided under `scripts` directory in order to run checks on either the workspace or all examples. Please do this before pushing work in a PR.

## Examples

For building the example smart contracts found under `examples` you will need to have [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) installed.

```
cargo install cargo-contract --force
```

Use the `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

### Build example contract and generate the contracts metadata

To build a single example and generate the contracts Wasm file, navigate to the root of the example smart contract and run:

```
cargo contract build
```

To generate the contract metadata (a.k.a. the contract ABI), run the following command:

```
cargo contract generate-metadata
```

You should now have an optimized `<contract-name>.wasm` file and an `metadata.json` file in the `target` folder of the contract.

For further information, please have a look at our [smart contracts workshop](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/).

## Hello, World! - The Flipper

The `Flipper` contract is a simple contract containing only a single `bool` value
that it can flip from `true` to `false` and vice versa and return the current state.

To create your own version of the flipper contract, you first need to initialize a new ink! project in your working directory.

```
cargo contract new flipper
```

Below you can see the code using the `ink_lang` version of ink!.

```rust
use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod flipper {
    /// The storage of the flipper contract.
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Flipper {
        /// The single `bool` value.
        value: bool,
    }

    impl Flipper {
        /// Instantiates a new Flipper contract and initializes `value` to `init_value`.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(init_value: bool) -> Self {
            Self {
                value: init_value,
            }
        }

        /// Instantiates a new Flipper contract and initializes `value` to `false` by default.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self::new(false)
        }

        /// Flips `value` from `true` to `false` or vice versa.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn flip(&mut self) {
            self.value = !self.value;
        }

        /// Returns the current state of `value`.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> bool {
            self.value
        }
    }

    /// Simply execute `cargo test` in order to test your contract using the below unit tests.
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn default_works() {
            let flipper = Flipper::default();
            assert_eq!(flipper.get(), false);
        }

        #[test]
        fn it_works() {
            let mut flipper = Flipper::new(false);
            assert_eq!(flipper.get(), false);
            flipper.flip();
            assert_eq!(flipper.get(), true);
        }
    }
}
```

Place this code in the `./lib.rs` file of your flipper contract and run `cargo contract build && cargo contract generate-metadata` to build your first ink! smart contract example.
